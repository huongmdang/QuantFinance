## 3. PCA technique in currency replication.

## Welcome to Project 2.
## PCA technique in currency replication.

Much appreciate your ongoing interest until now!

#### Description: 

Project 2 is to answer the common question in the predictive model. That is how to combine the variables such that it still keeps the significant anticipation power but also minimizes the existing noise. Specifically, we are going to replicate AUD/USD return given the price of 11 other pairs basket. The replicated result is then compared to the true values to know its efficiency. 
- Compute PCA to extract the number of optimal components.
- Estimate the weight of each component selected in the previous step.
- Replicate the target return and compare with the true values.
