## Welcome to my Project 1 
## Eigenvalues approach applied Excess out-of-sample covariance.

Thanks for your interest thus far!

#### Description:

Project 1 is going to examine the relation between the eigenvalues and the volatility of currency pairs through: 
- Analyze the correlation between G10 currencies using correlation heatmap.
- Derive the eigenvalues applying the concept of excess out-of-sample-covariance, which is thought to be a useful metric for explaining volatility.
- Compare empirical and theoretical eigenvalues density to find the optimal set of parameters.

#### How to install:

Save and run this file [eigenvalues_FX.ipynb](https://github.com/huongmdang/QuantFinance/blob/main/Eigenvalues/src/eigenvalues_FX.ipynb) in the same parent directory 'Datasets' indicated in the [first section](https://github.com/huongmdang/QuantFinance/tree/main/FXData).
